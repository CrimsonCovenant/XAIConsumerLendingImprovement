# Statistically Rigorous XAI for Financial Models Under Drift

## Project Synopsis

This project investigates a critical challenge in modern machine learning: the statistical reliability of model explanations, particularly for high-stakes financial decisions like loan underwriting. While complex models achieve high predictive accuracy, the explanations generated by popular XAI methods like SHAP or LIME often lack statistical guarantees. Their stability is especially questionable when the underlying data distribution shifts over time—a phenomenon known as **model drift**.

The core objective of this work is to develop and implement a framework for **statistically rigorous Explainable AI** from first principles. This involves moving beyond point-estimate explanations to quantify their uncertainty. Key goals include:

1.  **Implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch** to gain a fundamental understanding of their mechanics.
2.  Developing methods to compute **confidence intervals for feature attributions**, providing a measure of reliability for each explanation.
3.  Designing and applying statistical tests to **detect significant "explanation drift"** over time, signaling when a model's decision-making logic may be degrading.

By focusing on the statistical underpinnings of interpretability, this project aims to build more trustworthy and robust AI systems suitable for deployment in regulated financial environments.

## Data

The analysis is conducted on the **Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) dataset**, spanning from **2008 to 2024**. This public dataset provides millions of loan application records from financial institutions across the United States. Its extensive timeframe—covering major economic events like the 2008 financial crisis, a period of quantitative easing, and recent inflationary pressures—makes it an ideal resource for studying how model behavior and explanations evolve. The rich set of features, including applicant financials, loan characteristics, and lender actions, allows for the development of realistic predictive models whose explanatory logic can be rigorously tested for stability across different economic regimes.
